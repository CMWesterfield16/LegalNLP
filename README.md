# LegalStyleComparison

To run style comparison for both the Supreme Court opinions and State cases, run:
  ./run_system.sh

If you wish to just run one or the other, comment out the appropriate line in run_system.sh such that:
  - State: Only keep "python word_analysis_state.py"
  - Supreme Court: Only keep "python word_analysis_supreme_court.py"
