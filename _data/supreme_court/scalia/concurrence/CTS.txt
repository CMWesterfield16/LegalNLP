Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join all but Part II­D of Justice KENNEDY's opinion. I do not join that Part because I remain convinced that "[t]he proper rule of construction for express preemption provisions is ... the one that is customary for statutory provisions in general: Their language should be given its ordinary meaning." Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 548, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The contrary notion--that express preemption provisions must be construed narrowly--was "extraordinary and unprecedented" when this Court announced it two decades ago, id., at 544, 112 S.Ct. 2608, and since then our reliance on it has been sporadic at best, see Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70, 99­103, 129 S.Ct. 538, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). For the reasons given in the balance of the opinion, ordinary principles of statutory construction demonstrate that 42 U.S.C. § 9658 preempts only statutes of limitation and not statutes of repose.
