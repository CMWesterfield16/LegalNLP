Justice SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I agree with the Court that intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a family member "has, as an element, the use ... of physical force," 18 U.S.C. ง ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), and thus constitutes a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence," ง 922(g)(9). I write separately, however, because I reach that conclusion on narrower grounds.
I
Our decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), is the natural place to begin. Johnson is significant here because it concluded that "the phrase `physical force' means violent force--that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person." Id., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265 (second emphasis added). This is an easy case if the phrase "physical force" has the same meaning in ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" for purposes of ง 922(g)(9), as it does in ง 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in Johnson, since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without *1417 using force "capable of" producing that result.
There are good reasons to give the phrase Johnson 's interpretation. One is the presumption of consistent usage-- the rule of thumb that a term generally means the same thing each time it is used. Although the presumption is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the same enactment, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U.S. 21, 33ญ34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005), it is equally relevant "when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes," Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 233, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005) (plurality opinion) see also Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412 U.S. 427, 428, 93 S.Ct. 2201, 37 L.Ed.2d 48 (1973) (per curiam ). This case is a textbook candidate for application of the SmithญNorthcross branch of the rule. The "physical force" clauses at issue here and in Johnson are worded in nearly identical fashion: The former defines a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" as an offense that "has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force," ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a "violent felony" as an offense that "has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another," ง 924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes are designed to promote public safety by deterring a class of criminals from possessing firearms.
Respondent's arguments fail to overcome the presumption of consistent usage. In respondent's view, "physical force" cannot mean "any force that produces any pain or bodily injury," Brief for Respondent 25, because ง 921(a)(33)(A) (ii) defines a violent crime and one can inflict all sorts of minor injuries--bruises, paper cuts, etc.--by engaging in nonviolent behavior. Respondent therefore reasons that ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capable of inflicting "serious" bodily injury. That requirement is more demanding than both of the plausible meanings of "physical force" we identified in Johnson : commonlaw offensive touching (which Johnson rejected) and force capable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or otherwise. See 559 U.S., at 138ญ140, 130 S.Ct. 1265. It would be surpassing strange to read a statute defining a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" as requiring greater force than the similarly worded statute in Johnson, which defined a "violent felony," and respondent does not make a convincing case for taking that extraordinary step.
For these reasons, I would give "physical force" the same meaning in ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as in Johnson. The rest of the analysis is straightforward. Because "intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury," App. 27, categorically involves the use of "force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person," 559 U.S., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, respondent's 2001 domesticassault conviction qualifies as a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" under ง 922(g)(9). 1  I would reverse the judgment below on that basis and remand for further proceedings.
II
Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower interpretation of ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader one that treats any offensive touching, no matter how slight, as sufficient. That expansive commonlaw definition *1418 cannot be squared with relevant precedent or statutory text.
We have twice addressed the meaning of "physical force" in the context of provisions that define a class of violent crimes. Both times, we concluded that "physical force" means violent force. In Johnson, we thought it "clear that in the context of a statutory definition of `violent felony,' the phrase `physical force' means violent force." Id., at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265. And we held that commonlaw offensive touching--the same type of force the Court today holds does constitute "physical force"--is not sufficiently violent to satisfy the Armed Career Criminal Act's "physical force" requirement. See id., at 140ญ144, 130 S.Ct. 1265. Our analysis in Johnson was premised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the generic federal "crime of violence" statute, 18 U.S.C. ง 16. In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 11, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), we observed that ง 16(a)--which defines a "crime of violence" as "an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or

property of another"--comprehends "a category of violent, active crimes." The textual similarity between ง 921(a)(33) (A)(ii)'s "physical force" clause and the clauses at issue in Johnson and Leocal thus raises the question: Why should the same meaning not apply here?
The Court gives four responses that merit discussion, none of which withstands scrutiny. First, the Court invokes the " `settled principle of interpretation that, absent other indication, "Congress intends to incorporate the wellsettled meaning of the commonlaw terms it uses." ' " Ante, at 1410 (quoting Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. ญญญญ, ญญญญ, 133 S.Ct. 2720, 2724, 186 L.Ed.2d 794 (2013)). That principle is of limited relevance, since the presumption of consistent statutory meaning is precisely "other indication" that ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) does not incorporate the common law meaning. Anyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle cited by the Court is that when " `a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it.' " Sekhar, supra, at ญญญญ, 133 S.Ct., at 2724 (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947) emphasis added). Section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) was enacted after the statutes involved in Johnson and Leocal, 2  and its "physical force" clause is quite obviously modeled on theirs.
Second, the Court asserts that any interpretation of "physical force" that excludes offensive touching "would have rendered ง 922(g)(9) inoperative in many States at the time of its enactment." Ante, at 1413. But there is no interpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be given their broadest possible application, and ง 922(g) (9) without offensive touching would have had application in fourfifths of the States. Although domestic violence was "routinely prosecuted" under misdemeanor assault or battery statutes when Congress enacted ง 922(g) (9), United States v. Hayes, 555 U.S. 415, 427, 129 S.Ct. 1079, 172 L.Ed.2d 816 (2009), and such statutes generally prohibited "both offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury" or "only the latter," ante, at 1412 ญ 1413, it does not follow that interpreting "physical force" to mean violent force would have rendered ง 922(g) (9) a*1419 practical nullity. To the contrary, ง 922(g)(9) would have worked perfectly well in 38 of the 48 States that had misdemeanor assault or battery statutes at the time of ง 922(g)(9)'s enactment. At that point, 19 States had statutes that covered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touching, 3  and 19 more had statutes that prohibited both of types of conduct, but did so in a divisible manner--thus making it possible to identify the basis for a conviction by inspecting charging documents and similar materials, see Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. ญญญญ, ญญญญ, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283ญ2285, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). 4  That leaves only 10 States whose misdemeanor assault or battery statutes (1) prohibited offensive touching, and (2) were framed in such a way that offensive touching was indivisible from physical violence. 5  The fact that ง 922(g)(9) would not have applied immediately in 10 States is hardly enough to trigger the presumption against ineffectiveness--the idea that Congress presumably does not enact useless laws. Compare Hayes, supra, at 427, 129 S.Ct. 1079 (rejecting an interpretation that supposedly would have rendered ง 922(g)(9) " `a dead letter' in some twothirds of the States"). I think it far more plausible that Congress enacted a statute that covered domesticviolence convictions in fourfifths of the States, and left it to the handful of nonconforming States to change their laws (as some have), than that Congress adopted a meaning of "domestic violence" that included the slightest unwanted touching.
Third, the Court seizes on the one and only meaningful distinction between ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) and the other provisions referred to above: that it defines a violent "misdemeanor" rather than a "violent felony" or an undifferentiated "crime of violence." Ante, at 1410 ญ 1411. We properly take account of the term being defined when interpreting "an unclear definitional phrase." United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 474, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) but see *1420 Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U.S. 687, 717ญ 719, 115 S.Ct. 2407, 132 L.Ed.2d 597 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But when we do so, we consider the entire term being defined, not just part of it. Here, the term being defined is "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence." Applying the termtobedefined canon thus yields the unremarkable conclusion that "physical force" in ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the type of force involved in violent misdemeanors (such as bodilyinjury offenses) rather than nonviolent ones (such as offensive touching).
Fourth, and finally, the Court seeks to evade Johnson and Leocal on the ground that " `domestic violence' encompasses a range of force broader than that which constitutes `violence' simpliciter." Ante, at 1411, n. 4. That is to say, an act need not be violent to qualify as "domestic violence." That absurdity is not only at war with the English language, it is flatly inconsistent with definitions of "domestic violence" from the period surrounding ง 921(a)(33)(A) (ii)'s enactment. At the time, dictionaries defined "domestic violence" as, for instance, "[v]iolence between members of a household, usu. spouses an assault or other violent act committed by one member of a household against another," Black's Law Dictionary 1564 (7th ed. 1999), and "[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one's spouse or domestic partner," American Heritage Dictionary 534 (4th ed. 2000). 6  Those definitions, combined with the absence of "domestic violence" entries in earlier dictionaries, see, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed. 1990) American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992), make it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a "term of art" definition "encompassing acts that one might not characterize as `violent' in a nondomestic context," ante, at 1411.

The Court's inventive, nonviolent definition fares no better when judged against other accepted sources of meaning. Current dictionaries give "domestic violence" the same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs in a domestic context. See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) ("[p]hysical abuse of a household member, especially one's spouse or domestic partner"). The same goes for definitions of "domestic violence" found in other federal statutes. 7  Indeed, Congress defined "crime of domestic violence" as a "crime of violence" in another section of the same bill that enacted ง 921(a)(33)(A)(ii). See ง 350(a), 110 Stat. 3009ญ639, codified at 8 U.S.C. ง 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).
The Court ignores these authorities and instead bases its definition on an amicus brief filed by the National Network to End Domestic Violence and other private organizations, 8  and two publications issued *1421 by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women. The amicus brief provides a series of definitions--drawn from law review articles, foreigngovernment bureaus, and similar sources--that include such a wide range of nonviolent and even nonphysical conduct that they cannot possibly be relevant to the meaning of a statute requiring "physical force," or to the legal meaning of "domestic violence" (as opposed to the meaning desired by private and governmental advocacy groups). For example, amici's definitions describe as "domestic violence" acts that "humiliate, isolate, frighten, ... [and] blame ... someone" "acts of omission" "excessive monitoring of a woman's behavior, repeated accusations of infidelity, and controlling with whom she has contact." Brief for National Network to End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae 5ญ8, and nn. 7, 11. The offerings of the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women are equally capacious and (to put it mildly) unconventional. Its publications define "domestic violence" as "a pattern of abusive behavior ... used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another," including "[u]ndermining an individual's sense of selfworth," "namecalling," and "damaging one's relationship with his or her children." See, e.g., Domestic Violence, online at http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/domviolence. htm (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 21, 2014, and available in the Clerk of Court's case file). 9
Of course these private organizations and the Department of Justice's (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to define "domestic violence" any way they want for their own purposes--purposes that can include (quite literally) giving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad name. (What is more abhorrent than violence against women?) But when they (and the Court) impose their allembracing definition on the rest of us, they not only distort the law, they impoverish the language. When everything is domestic violence, nothing is. Congress will have to come up with a new word (I cannot imagine what it would be) to denote actual domestic violence.
Although the Justice Department's definitions ought to be deemed unreliable in toto on the basis of their extravagant extensions alone (falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus ), the Court chooses to focus only upon the physical actions that they include, viz., "[h]itting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, [and] hair pulling." Ibid. None of those actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive touching, and all of them are capable of causing physical pain or injury. Cf. *1422 Johnson, 559 U.S., at 143, 130 S.Ct. 1265 (identifying "a slap in the face" as conduct that might rise to the level of violent force). And in any event, the Department of Justice thankfully receives no deference in our interpretation of the criminal laws whose claimed violation the Department of Justice prosecutes. See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 264, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (citing Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152, 177, 110 S.Ct. 997, 108 L.Ed.2d 132 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)). The same ought to be said of advocacy organizations, such as amici, that (unlike dictionary publishers) have a vested interest in expanding the definition of "domestic violence" in order to broaden the base of individuals eligible for support services. 10
This is a straightforward statutoryinterpretation case that the parties and the Court have needlessly complicated. Precedent, text, and common sense all dictate that the term "physical force," when used to define a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence," requires force capable of causing physical pain or bodily injury.

Respondent argues at length that Tenn.Code Ann. ง 39ญ13ญ111(b) (2013 Supp.) does not require the 1 "use" of physical force, since it is possible to cause bodily injury through deceit or other nonviolent
means. Brief for Respondent 30ญ42. The argument fails for the reasons given by the Court. See ante, at 1414 ญ 1415.

6 Definitions of "physical force" from the same period are also at odds with the Court's nonviolent interpretation of that phrase. See Black's Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999) ("[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim") id., at 1147 (6th ed. 1990) ("[f]orce applied to the body actual violence").
7 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ง 2261(a)(1) (defining as "[i]nterstate domestic violence" certain "crime[s] of violence") ง 3561(b) ("The term `domestic violence crime' means a crime of violence ... in which the victim or intended victim is the [defendant's] spouse" or other qualifying relation) 25 U.S.C.A. ง 1304(a) (2) ("The term `domestic violence' means violence committed by a current or former spouse or" other qualifying relation) 42 U.S.C.A. ง 13925(a)(8) (Sept. 2013 Supp.) ("The term `domestic violence' includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse" or other qualifying relation).
8 The other organizations on the brief are the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project, Legal Momentum, and innumerable state organizations against domestic violence.
9 The Court refers in a footnote to two additional socialscience definitions, neither of which aids the Court's cause. See ante, at 1411 ญ 1412, n. 5. The first is drawn from a healthcare manual that provides "a behavioral definition of domestic violence ... rather than a legal definition, since a behavioral definition is more comprehensive and more relevant to the health care setting." A. Ganley, Understanding Domestic Violence, in Improving the Health Care Response to Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual for Health Care Providers 18 (2d ed. 1996) (emphasis added), online at http://www.futureswithoutviolence. org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/improving_healthcare_manual_1.pdf. Here, of course, we are concerned with the less comprehensive legal definition. The second definition referred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with "overt violence," which in its least serious

form consists of "painful pinching or squeezing." M. McCue, Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6 (1995) (emphasis added). That meaning is consistent with Johnson 's definition of "physical force," but it plainly does not include harmless offensive touching.
10 See, e.g., National Network to End Domestic Violence, Reauthorize The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act 1 (Sept. 22, 2010) (advocating the expansion of a program assisting victims of domestic violence to include victims of "dating violence" and thereby "ensure that all victims in danger can access services"), online at http://nnedv. org/downloads/Policy/FVPSA_fact_sheet_92210.pdf.
