Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, dissenting. I do not believe that the question the Court answers is properly before us. Disputes between governmental branches or departments regarding the allocation of political power do not in my view constitute "cases" or "controversies" committed to our resolution by Art. III, ง 2, of the Constitution.
What those who framed and ratified the Constitution had in mind when they entrusted the "judicial Power" to a separate and coequal branch of the Federal Government was the judicial power they were familiar with--that traditionally exercised by English and American courts. The "cases" and "controversies" that those courts entertained did not include suits between units of government regarding their legitimate powers. The job of the courts was, in Chief Justice Marshall's words, "solely, to decide on the rights of individuals," Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Tocqueville considered this one reason the new democracy could safely confer upon courts the immense power to hold legislation unconstitutional:
"[B]y leaving it to private interest to censure the law, and by intimately uniting the trial of the law with the trial of an individual, legislation is protected from wanton assaults and from the daily aggressions of party spirit....
"I am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at once most favorable to liberty and to public order. If the judge could only attack the legislator only openly and directly, he would sometimes be afraid to oppose him and at other times party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn.... But the American judge is brought into the political arena independently of his own will. He judges the law only because he is obliged to judge a case. The political question that he is called upon to resolve is connected with the interests of the parties, and he cannot refuse to decide it without a denial of justice." A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 102ญ03 (P. Bradley ed. 1948).
*2695 That doctrine of standing, that jurisdictional limitation upon our powers, does not have as its purpose (as the majority assumes) merely to assure that we will decide disputes in concrete factual contexts that enable "realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action," ante, at 2665. To the contrary. "[T]he law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic idea--the idea of separation of powers." Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). It keeps us minding our own business.
We consult history and judicial tradition to determine whether a given " `disput[e is] appropriately resolved through the judicial process.' " Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). What history and judicial tradition show is that courts do not resolve direct disputes between two political branches of the same government regarding their respective powers. Nearly every separation ofpowers case presents questions like the ones in this case. But we have never passed on a separationofpowers question raised directly by a governmental subunit's complaint. We have always resolved those questions in the context of a private lawsuit in which the claim or defense depends on the constitutional validity of action by one of the governmental subunits that has caused a private party concrete harm. That is why, for example, it took this Court over 50 years to rule upon the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act, passed in 1867. If the law of standing had been otherwise, "presumably President Wilson, or Presidents Grant and Cleveland before him, would ... have had standing, and could have challenged the law preventing the removal of a Presidential appointee without the consent of Congress." Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 828, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997).
We do not have to look far back in the United States Reports to find other separationofpowers cases which, if the Arizona Legislature's theory of standing is correct, took an awfully circuitous route to get here. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, ญญญ U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 2076, ญญญ L.Ed.2d ญญญญ (2015), the President could have sued for an injunction against Congress's attempted "direct usurpation" of his constitutionallyconferred authority to pronounce on foreign relations. Or in Wellness Int'l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 1932, ญญญ L.Ed.2d ญญญญ (2015), a Federal District Judge could have sought a declaratory judgment that a bankruptcy court's adjudicating a Stern claim improperly usurped his constitutionally conferred authority to decide cases and controversies. Or in NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. ญญญญ, 134 S.Ct. 2550, 189 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014), the Senate could have sued the President, claiming a direct usurpation of its prerogative to advise on and consent to Presidential appointments. Each of these cases involved the allocation of power to one or more branches of a government and we surely would have dismissed suits arising in the hypothesized fashions.
We have affirmatively rejected arguments for jurisdiction in cases like this one. For example, in Raines, 521 U.S., at 829ญ830, 117 S.Ct. 2312, we refused to allow Members of Congress to challenge the Line Item Veto Act, which they claimed " `unconstitutionally expand[ed] the President's power' " and " `alter[ed] the constitutional balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches.' " Id., at 816, 117 S.Ct. 2312. In Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 479ญ480, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), we refused to allow a State to pursue its claim that a conditional congressional appropriation "constitute[d] an effective means of inducing the States to *2696 yield a portion of their

sovereign rights." (And Mellon involved a contention that one government infringed upon another government's power--far closer to the traditional partyversusparty lawsuit than is an intragovernmental dispute.) We put it plainly: "In the last analysis, the complaint of the plaintiff State is brought to the naked contention that Congress has usurped the reserved powers of the several States," id., at 483, 43 S.Ct. 597--and because the State could not show a discrete harm except the alleged usurpation of its powers, we refused to allow the State's appeal.
The sole precedent the Court relies upon is Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 59 S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939). Coleman can be distinguished from the present case as readily as it was distinguished in Raines. In Raines, the accurateinfact (but inconsequentialinprinciple) distinction was that the Senators in Coleman had their votes nullified, whereas the Members of Congress claimed that their votes could merely be rendered ineffective by a Presidential lineitem veto. Raines, supra, at 823ญ824, 117 S.Ct. 2312. In the present case we could make the accurateinfact distinction that in Coleman individual legislators were found to have standing, whereas here it is the governmental body, the ArizonaLegislature, that seeks to bring suit. But the reality is that the supposed holding of Coleman stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of our jurisprudence, which denies standing for intragovernmental disputes.
Coleman was a peculiar case that may well stand for nothing. The opinion discussing and finding standing, and going on to affirm the Kansas Supreme Court, was written by Chief Justice Hughes and announced by Justice Stone. Justice Frankfurter, joined by three other Justices, held there was no standing, and would have dismissed the petition (leaving the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court in place). Justice Butler, joined by Justice McReynolds, dissented (neither joining Hughes's opinion nor separately discussing standing) and would have reversed the Kansas Supreme Court.
That adds up to two votes to affirm on the merits, two to reverse on the merits (without discussing standing) and four to dismiss for lack of standing. Justice Stanley Reed, who was on the Court and apparently participated in the case, is not mentioned in any of the opinions recorded in the United States Reports. So, in order to find Coleman a binding precedent on standing, rather than a 4ญtoญ4 standoff, one must assume that Justice Reed voted with Hughes. There is some reason to make that assumption: The four Justices rejecting standing went on to discuss the merits, because "the ruling of the Court just announced removes from the case the question of petitioners' standing to sue." 307 U.S., at 456, 59 S.Ct. 972 (Black, J., concurring). But then again, if nine Justices participated, how could it be that on one of the two issues in the case the Court was "equally divided and therefore ... expresse[d] no opinion"? Id., at 447, 59 S.Ct. 972.
A pretty shaky foundation for a significant precedential ruling. Besides that, the two dissenters' mere assumption of standing--neither saying anything about the subject nor joining Hughes's opinion on the point--produces (if you assume Reed joined Hughes) a majority for standing but no majority opinion explaining why. And even under the most generous assumptions, since the Court's judgment on the issue it resolved rested on the ground that that issue presented a political question--which is itself a rejection of jurisdiction, *2697 Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. ญญญญ, 132 S.Ct. 1421, 1426ญ1427, 182 L.Ed.2d 423 (2012)--Coleman 's discussion of the additional jurisdictional issue of standing was quite superfluous and arguably nothing but dictum. The peculiar decision in Coleman should be charitably ignored.
The Court asserts, quoting Raines, 521 U.S., at 819ญ820, 117 S.Ct. 2312, that the Court's standing analysis has been "especially rigorous when reaching the merits of the dispute would force [the Court] to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional." Ante, at 2665, n. 12. The cases cited to support this dictum fail to do so they are merely cases where a determination of unconstitutionality is avoided by applying what there is no reason to believe is anything other than normal standing requirements. It seems to me utterly implausible that the Framers wanted federal courts limited to traditional judicial cases only when they were pronouncing upon the rights of Congress and the President, and not when they were treading upon the powers of state legislatures and executives. Quite to the contrary, I think they would be all the more averse to unprecedented judicial meddling by federal courts with the branches of their state governments.
I would dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction.
* * *
Normally, having arrived at that conclusion, I would express no opinion on the merits unless my vote was necessary to enable the Court to produce a judgment. In the present case, however, the majority's resolution of the merits question ("legislature" means "the people") is so outrageously wrong, so utterly devoid of textual or historic support, so flatly in contradiction of prior Supreme Court cases, so obviously the willful product of hostility to districting by state legislatures, that I cannot avoid adding my vote to the devastating dissent of the Chief Justice.

Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, dissenting. Reading today's opinion, one would think the Court is a great defender of direct democracy in the States. As it reads "the Legislature" out of the Times, Places and Manner Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, ง 4, the majority offers a paean to the ballot initiative. It speaks in glowing terms of the "characteristic of our federal system that States retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes." Ante, at 2673. And it urges "[d]eference to state lawmaking" so that States may perform their vital function as " `laboratories' " of democracy. Ante, at 2673.
These sentiments are difficult to accept. The conduct of the Court in so many other cases reveals a different attitude toward the States in general and ballot initiatives in particular. Just last week, in the antithesis of deference to state lawmaking through direct democracy, the Court cast aside state laws across the country--many of which were enacted through ballot initiative--that reflected the traditional definition of marriage. See Obergefell v. Hodges, ญญญ U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 2584, ญญญ L.Ed.2d ญญญญ, 2015 WL 2473451 (2015).
This Court's tradition of disdain for state ballot initiatives goes back quite a while. Two decades ago, it held unconstitutional an Arkansas ballot initiative imposing term limits on that State's Members of Congress, finding "little significance" in the fact that such term limits were adopted by popular referendum. U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 822, n. 32, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 131 L.Ed.2d 881 (1995). One year later, it held unconstitutional a ballot initiative that would have prevented the enactment of laws under which " `homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships [would] constitute or otherwise be the basis of ... any minority status, quota preferences, protected *2698 status or claim of discrimination.' " Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 624, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). The Court neither gave deference to state lawmaking nor said anything about the virtues of direct democracy. It instead declared that the result of the ballot initiative was an aberration--that "[i]t is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort." Id., at 633, 116 S.Ct. 1620. But if "constitutional tradition" is the measuring stick, then it is hard to understand how the Court condones a redistricting practice that was unheard of for nearly 200 years after the ratification of the Constitution and that conflicts with the express constitutional command that election laws "be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof," Art. I, ง 4.
The Court's lack of respect for ballot initiatives is evident not only in what it has done, but in what it has failed to do. Just this Term, the Court repeatedly refused to review cases in which the Courts of Appeals had set aside state laws passed through ballot initiative. See, e.g., County of Maricopa v. LopezญValenzuela, 575 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 2046, ญญญ L.Ed.2d ญญญญ (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (state constitutional amendment denying bail for illegal aliens arrested in certain circumstances) Herbert v. Kitchen, 574 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 396, 190 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014) (state constitutional amendment retaining traditional definition of marriage) Smith v. Bishop, 574 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 271, 190 L.Ed.2d 139 (2014) (same) Rainey v. Bostic, 574 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 286, 190 L.Ed.2d 140 (2014) (same) Walker v. Wolf, 574 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 316, 190 L.Ed.2d 142 (2014) (same). It did so despite warnings that its indifference to such cases would "only embolden the lower courts to reject state laws on questionable constitutional grounds." LopezญValenzuela, supra, at ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct., at 2047. And it refused to grant a stay pending appeal of a decision purporting to require the State of Alabama to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples, even though Alabama's licensing laws had not been challenged in that case. See Strange v. Searcy, 574 U.S. ญญญญ, 135 S.Ct. 940, 191 L.Ed.2d 149 (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of application for stay). In each decision, the cheers for direct democracy were conspicuously absent.

Sometimes disapproval of ballot initiatives has been even more blatant. Just last Term, one dissenting opinion castigated the product of a state ballot initiative as "stymieing the right of racial minorities to participate in the political process." Schuette v. BAMN, 572 U.S. ญญญญ, ญญญญ, 134 S.Ct. 1623, 1651, 188 L.Ed.2d 613 (2014) (SOTOMAYOR, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., dissenting). It did not hail the ballot initiative as the result of a "State's empowerment of its people," ante, at 2668, nor offer any deference to state lawmaking. Instead, it complained that "[t]he majority of Michigan voters changed the rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the existing political process...." Schuette, 572 U.S., at ญญญญ, 134 S.Ct., at 1653. And it criticized state ballot initiatives as biased against racial minorities because such minorities "face an especially uphill battle" in seeking the passage of such initiatives. Id., at ญญญญ, 134 S.Ct., at 1662. How quickly the tune has changed.
And how striking that it changed here. The ballot initiative in this case, unlike those that the Court has previously treated so dismissively, was unusually democracyreducing. It did not ask the people to approve a particular redistricting plan through direct democracy, but instead to take districting away from the people's representatives and give it to an unelected committee, thereby reducing democratic control over the process in the future. The Court's characterization of this as direct democracy at its best is rather like *2699 praising a plebiscite in a "banana republic" that installs a strongman as President for Life. And wrapping the analysis in a cloak of federalism does little to conceal the flaws in the Court's reasoning.
I would dispense with the faux federalism and would instead treat the States in an evenhanded manner. That means applying the Constitution as written. Although the straightforward text of Article I, ง 4, prohibits redistricting by an unelected, independentcommission, Article III limits our power to deciding cases or controversies. Because I agree with Justice SCALIA that the Arizona Legislature lacks Article III standing to assert an institutional injury against another entity of state government, I would dismiss its suit. I respectfully dissent.
