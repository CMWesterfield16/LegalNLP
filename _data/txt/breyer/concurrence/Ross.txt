Justice BREYER, concurring in part. I join the opinion of the Court, with the exception that I described in *1863 Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). There, I agreed that "Congress intended the term `exhausted' to `mean what the term means in administrative law, where exhaustion means proper exhaustion.' " Id., at 103, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (opinion concurring in judgment). Though that statutory term does not encompass "freewheeling" exceptions for any " `special circumstanc[e],' " ante, at 1855, it does include administrative law's "wellestablished exceptions to exhaustion." Woodford, supra, at 103, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (opinion of BREYER, J.). I believe that such exceptions, though not necessary to the Court's disposition of this case, may nevertheless apply where appropriate.
